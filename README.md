# 🕳️ Project zer0

Welcome to **Project zer0**, a dark escape room experience crafted in the shadows of something forgotten. You wake alone, trapped in a place that shouldn't exist, surrounded by cryptic messages, sealed drawers, and whispers of those who came before you... and never left.

## 🎮 About the Game

**Project zer0** is a minimalist, lore-rich escape room game built with a sharp focus on mystery, tension, and story. Every object you touch might tell you something — or hide something worse.

As you explore, you'll slowly piece together:
- Why you're here.
- What this place once was.
- And what *it* is now.

But don’t expect answers to come easy.

## 🧪 Why Play?

This is more than a room escape — it’s a test of attention, memory, and curiosity.

Every player uncovers the story differently. There are no tutorials. No blinking arrows. Just subtle guidance through world-building and your own instincts.

If you're the kind of person who reads between the lines, opens drawers **twice**, and still thinks about that one code from five rooms ago... this game is for you.
